## RIKA-Firenet adapter for ioBroker

Control your RIKA stoves over RIKA-Firenet.

## Information
* Get Informations like controls, sensors, features from your RIKA stove
* Set controls like on, off, heatingPower...

## Requirements
* You need a RIKA stove with RIKA-Firenet and an account at https://www.rika-firenet.com
* Polling-intervall minimum is 1 minute so you do not appear to be a DOS-Attacker against their websites.
* If working with javascript or blockly, change only 1 control simultaneously, because complete json have to be uploaded after modifying a control value (i'm working on this problem)
* This Adapter was developed for my RIKA PARO, but should also work with other RIKA stoves.

Fill textboxes in Adapter-Config
* Username: (E-Mail for your Rika account)
* Password: (Password for your Rika account)
* Stove-ID: (go to your Rika account and find out)
* Polling-Interval: (min 1 Minute)
